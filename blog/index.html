										Antibiotics, gel electrophoresis, the structure of DNA, restriction enzymes, polymerase
										chain reaction, CRISPR-Cas9, AlphaFold. These revolutionary scientific innovations are
										blue ocean discoveries.
										<br /><br />
										<img class="TextWrapRight" src="images/blue_ocean_strategy.jpeg" alt="blue_ocean_strategy", style="width: 27.5%; height: 27.5%">
										A blue ocean discovery is a play on a business concept called a blue ocean strategy. A
										blue ocean strategy refers to a new business model, product, or otherwise, that creates
										new market space and demand. In contrast, red ocean strategies require competing in
										existing markets, beating the competition, and exploiting existing demand. The red ocean
										is a stressful and ruthless place. (These concepts were introduced and elaborated on in
										the well-read book ‚ÄúBlue Ocean Strategy‚Äù by W. Chan Kim and Ren√©e Mauborgne.)
										<br /><br />
										Yellowtail, a wine company from Australia, is an example of a blue ocean product in the wine
										industry. Before Yellowtail, there were two wine categories: premium and budget wines.
										These groups differed in price, use of enological terminology, aging quality, vineyard
										prestige and legacy, and complexity. Yellowtail created a new market in the US wine
										industry by developing an easy-to-drink, fun, and adventurous wine. Yellowtail removed the
										complexity of enological terms and pretentiousness of prestige and legacy‚Äîa new brand of
										wine that had no competitors emerged. In four years, Yellowtail became the best-selling
										red wine in the United States, beating out Californian, French, and Italian wines that
										had dominated the US market before.
										<br /><br />
										There are so many scientific equivalents of blue ocean strategies/discoveries. For example,
										AlphaFold implemented a novel machine-learning approach for protein structure prediction
										wrapped in an easy-to-use interface. CRISPR-Cas9 revolutionized genome editing in a similar
										way‚Äìunprecedented precision and scalability for the masses to adopt the technology.
										AlphaFold and CRISPR-Cas9 technology removed the intimidation of protein structure
										prediction and genome editing, respectively. There are also many scientific equivalents of
										red oceans. Everybody knows where the red oceans are in their field, so I will not go
										over them here.
										<br /><br />
										As scientists, I think we could benefit from pondering what blue ocean discoveries await.
										What next discovery will yield insight to last through the years? What will science look
										like in five to 10 years? How do we move toward that future today? This is, of course,
										difficult to predict, but if anything, it is a fun exercise that pulls you out of the
										weeds of an ongoing project and facilitates looking at the big picture.
										<br /><br />
										You know the shortcomings and areas ripe for
										improvement in your field. What will your blue ocean discovery be?

										Suppose you're sitting in a cold room. In front of you is a cup of ice. Slowly, the room begins to warm.
										At first, the room is 25 degrees Fahrenheit but slowly warms to 26 degrees. Then 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. The ice is still solid.
										Next, a transformation happens at 32 degrees‚Äîthe ice begins to melt. At first, one-degree changes appeared to
										have done nothing but accumulated to be able to melt the ice. This example from <i>Atomic Habits</i> by James Clear
										brings up an important point: the impact of incremental change is often not manifested until much later.
										<br /><br />
										<img class="TextWrapRight" src="images/habits_vs_motivation.jpeg" alt="habits vs motivation", style="width: 45%; height: 45%">
										We often convince ourselves that big actions lead to big success. However, I'm not sure I agree. Despite small
										(even miniature and microscopic-sized) successes never feeling too exciting or satisfying at a given moment,
										incremental success can significantly impact over time and are more useful than bursts of motivation (see image).
										For example, if you improve each day for one year by 1%,
										you'll end up 37 times better than when you started (1.01<sup>365</sup> = 37.78). The converse is also true. If you have bad
										habits that make you 1% worse every day, the accumulation of little backward steps can become much greater
										(0.99<sup>365</sup> = 0.03). (This is another example from <i>Atomic Habits</i> by James Clear.)
										This is compounding interest in self-improvement in action‚Äîsmall habits now make significant changes later. It's always difficult to appreciate this in the moment of a small practice, but it is worth it later.
										<br /><br />
										Importantly, change is about the system in place and not the goals. Goals only change your life for a moment;
										however, systems give you a framework for continuous improvement. For example, suppose your goal as a scientist
										is to publish a paper (which happens to be a "typical" requirement to get a Ph.D. in biosciences at institutions
										in the United States). What will motivate you after you publish that one manuscript? What will inspire you to
										continue improving as a scientist? Thus, the goal is not to get a Ph.D.; rather, the goal should be to have a system in place for continued scientific discovery and growth as a scientist. A sound system will facilitate continuous improvement as a scientist, enabling you to make more exciting discoveries. Your commitment to the process will help you progress.
										<br /><br />
										Next time your science career faces a challenge‚Äîa coding bug, a failed control experiment, or a challenging paragraph to write in a paper in your manuscript‚Äîthink about the habits that you are building. Tackle the challenge head-on. Improve by 1%‚Äîone step at a time. Soon, you will have walked miles.
