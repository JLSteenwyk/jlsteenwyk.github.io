					<center>
					In the spinning arms of a galaxy within an expanding universe<br />
					We are born to the biosphere on Mother Earth <br />
					The gift we receive is 3 billion heartbeats and 30,000 days<br /> 
					<br />
					Let’s step with care, caution, and content <br />
					Walk with certainty, direction, and purpose <br />
					Run with high cadence, bent knees, and enjoy the breeze<br />
					<br />
					Let’s speak clearly and concisely<br />
					Sing melodies soft and sweet<br />
					Respect the rhythm of silence and then repeat<br /> 
					<br />
					And for each step we take; for note we reverberate<br /> 
					Let’s share the landscape; Let’s share the soundscape<br /> 
					<br />
					Let’s share cultivar with those that cultivate like us<br /> 
					Malignant seeds have no place in our garden<br />
					<br />
					We don’t grow envy in the shadow of the rain<br /> 
					We don’t grow violence in the dark of night<br /> 
					<br />
					We grow strength, discipline, and virtue bound by strings of steel<br /> 
					We grow compassion, respect, and understanding united by love<br /> 
					We don’t long for greener grasses - we grow them<br /> 
					<br />
					And so, I say, with the precision of an infinite decimal <br />
					At the volume of an intimate decibel <br />
					The same closing remarks as Max Ehrmann in Desiderata,<br /> 
					“Be cheerful . Strive to be happy”<br /><br />

					The drooping eyes of His serenity dissipate <br />
					into an empty abyss carrying nothing<br />
					but a beaten carton of cigarettes.<br />
					The broken bi-focal glasses, unopened books,<br />
					bikes unpedaled, and primetime <br />
					splattered with idiotic formulaic episodes,<br />
					draining the function and fulfilling purpose <br />
					of our presence, of us.<br /><br />
					Us, the ones, driven to madness,<br />
					unknown to previous decades culminating, <br />
					in the fate of young brilliancy’s potential to explode <br />
					in a violent banging and popping, <br />
					the unbranded cataclysmic kaboom.<br />
					Consequently the unfamiliar melting, gooping, and dripping<br />
					of our own brains out of our own ears and<br />
					into the wastebasket of conformity’s mastermind<br />
					leaves our bodies to be the drones and do-nothings<br />
					of puppet-masters dressed in coats and ties.<br />
					It is Facebook, ‘what not to wear,’ Reebok pumps, <br />
					Doritos and MTV attacking the glory of boredom<br />
					leaving three-fourths of us in the dirty dumpsters<br />
					and the remaining gasping for air,<br />
					some contemplating suicide amongst price-tag materials<br />
					consuming themselves for consumerism, is the only thing they know.<br /><br />
					The dissonance is no longer there.<br />
					The abused machine has regressed thought<br />
					renaming the ‘rose-garden’ as just ‘thorns.’<br />
					We are suffocated by carbohydrate snacks,<br />
					twice-over processed meats, and question marks<br />
					created behind the curtains with no avail.<br />
					We have been trained to be anti-interrogative<br />
					as indistinguishable copies are produced<br />
					after years of riding the puppet-masters’ assembly line.<br />
					The curse, it is cast, Ginsberg and Burroughs <br />
					have been ordained into the hush of death<br />
					leaving the one’s unaffected by His hex<br />
					deprived of the all mighty pastel palette of whispers.<br /><br />
					The free minority have had to reconcile with their <br />
					desolated counterparts to make ends meet.<br />
					For the lonely hipster drowning in self-pity,<br />
					the quiet artist seeking intimacy and soul,<br />
					the lunch-time reader turning page after page,<br />
					for the unnamed, self conscious individual <br />
					trying to look forward as a cavalcade of empty nothings<br />
					fall onto his or her plate questioning the machine<br />
					and searching for a remedy to keep that<br />
					stomach full for just one night.<br />
					A remedy you wonder? A solution? An answer?<br /><br />
					All of this in time future and time past we will be.<br />
					We will be the next poets stirring the sleeping world<br />
					with overflowing words like T.S. Elliot,<br />
					we will be the next Albert Einstein<br />
					discovering the corners and awakening<br />
					the crevices of our own flowing minds,<br />
					we will be the next Pope John Paul II,<br />
					Andy Warhol, Barack Obama,<br />
					we will be the next face of hope.<br />
					Release the chains that bind,<br />
					the mind forged manacles, the obligation<br />
					we surrender to social networks.<br />
					The cure for boredom is not picking<br />
					split ends, or aimless channel up and <br />
					channel down on remotes detaching us <br />
					further from society. The cure is jazz, <br />
					Hitchcock and cranial freedom. The cure is us,<br />
					if we choose to be. We can be the cure.<br />
