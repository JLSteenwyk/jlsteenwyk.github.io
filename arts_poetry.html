										<h3>The gift we receive</h3>
										In the spinning arms of a galaxy within an expanding universe<br />
										We are born to the biosphere on Mother Earth<br />
										The gift we receive is 3 billion heartbeats and 30,000 days<br /> 
										<br />
										Let’s step with care, caution, and content<br />
										Walk with certainty, direction, and purpose<br />
										Run with high cadence, bent knees, and enjoy the breeze<br />
										<br />
										Let’s speak clearly and concisely<br />
										Sing melodies soft and sweet<br />
										Respect the rhythm of silence and then repeat<br /> 
										<br />
										And for each step we take; for note we reverberate<br /> 
										Let’s share the landscape; Let’s share the soundscape<br /> 
										<br />
										Let’s share cultivar with those that cultivate like us<br /> 
										Malignant seeds have no place in our garden<br />
										<br />
										We don’t grow envy in the shadow of the rain<br /> 
										We don’t grow violence in the dark of night<br /> 
										<br />
										We grow strength, discipline, and virtue bound by strings of steel<br /> 
										We grow compassion, respect, and understanding united by love<br /> 
										We don’t long for greener grasses - we grow them<br /> 
										<br />
										And so, I say, with the precision of an infinite decimal<br />
										At the volume of an intimate decibel<br />
										The same closing remarks as Max Ehrmann in Desiderata,<br /> 
										“Be cheerful. Strive to be happy”<br /><br />

										<h3>Honey don't you know</h3>
										Honey don’t you know, it’s a wild world out there<br /> 
										I’ll issue out a message, on a wing and a prayer<br /> 
										Be careful of the steeple and the castle in the air<br /> 
										Grow yourself a garden and grow out your hair<br /> 
										<br /> 
										Honey don’t you know, you’re like a blackberry vine<br /> 
										Thorny on the outside, but fruit so fine<br /> 
										With a shape so sacred, geometric crystalline<br /> 
										Dissolve my little fears because you’re turpentine<br /> 
										<br /> 
										Honey don’t you know, these things take time<br /> 
										But if we keep it honest, it’ll be sublime<br /> 
										Honey don’t you know, I’m gonna trade in a dime<br /> 
										To better understand you, Earth and maritime <br /> 
										<br /> 
										But if you ain’t got your ear to the horn<br /> 
										And if you ain’t gonna hear my warn<br /> 
										Fix it in your mind, you’re the one that I adore<br /> <br />

										<h3>Oh me oh my</h3>
										It was early in the morning and my brain was yawning<br /> 
										I was wondering how I got to you my dear<br /> 
										Maybe it was the blissness of how you do dismiss this<br /> 
										I think it's time we shed away our fear<br /> 
										<br /> 
										Oh me oh my<br /> 
										It's what we do<br /> 
										It's how we grow<br /> 
										It's what we knew<br /> 
										<br /> 
										So meet me by the willow, I didn't know that you were indigo<br /> 
										You are what I was hoping would appear<br /> 
										But now I am tongue tied, side effects not as advertised<br /> 
										Since when was this world so austere<br /> 
										<br /> 
										Oh me oh my<br /> 
										It's what we do<br /> 
										It's how we grow<br />

										<h3>Wait for me</h3>
										A city of love, a city of throes<br />
										A city of forks and knives and clothes<br />
										This must be it so I'll follow my nose<br />
										To where you are, that's where I'll go<br />
										<br />
										Thirty thousand days, so it goes<br />
										Endless forms and fallen mangos<br />
										The elements of your cargo<br />
										The unbearable being that you forgo<br />
										<br />
										A trigger pops and it's end game<br />
										Share our words, that was never a shame<br />
										But your life is yours to claim<br />
										Your glowing eyes never looked the same<br />
										<br />
										To be with you is a miracle<br />
										You are the light, you are the pinnacle<br />

										<h3>Circle of time</h3>
										The blackbird may chase the hawk far from its breed<br />
										But its still got to leave the nest in order to succeed<br />
										Now I may be wondering about too many things<br />
										But its got my mind stuck like unknown contingency<br />
										We may be connected by at most six degrees<br />
										But with all perfect honesty, it don't mean much to me<br />
										<br />							
										It may be five minutes or it may be five hours<br />
										This will be the time I'll have to learn to devour<br />
										The stars may align in the sky ever so bright<br />
										But with so many hues it's no longer black and white<br />
										And like a dog goes wandering in the grass hill and all<br />
										I may go wandering in a glass bottle tall<br />
										<br />
										I don't know how many times you've grown<br />
										But it's far more than I have ever shown<br />
										Everyday is just another milestone of undone déjà vu<br />
										<br />
										We may be headed in the right circle of time<br />
										But these rings, they may alter<br />
										We may be headed in the right circle of time<br />
										We just got to make sure<br />

										<h3>For once in my life</h3>
										Just for once in my life I want to see the villian fail<br />
										So I took off his mask to display him unveiled<br />
										I looked into his hollow eyes you can guess what I had seen<br />
										I am he and he is I if ya know what I mean<br />
										<br />
										Now I read about the marriage so hungry and dirty<br />
										The malignant little lies that butcher everything<br />
										I got a hoard of dishes in the sink left to clean<br />
										But I turn to the bourbon from my unkempt canteen<br />
										<br />
										Where do you go when your home is falling apart?<br />
										Where do you go when it's charred by the fire you start?<br />
										<br />
										I don't know how much longer I can stand this nihilist feat<br />
										It's a job oh, it's a chore, it attacks me in my dreams<br />
										Six pairs of black socks and underwear I need<br />
										Percholating ideas about floating downstream<br />
										<br />
										I walked right through the labyrinth, right through the house of leaves<br />
										I was bleedin', screamin' disbelievin' what I had percieved<br />
										It killed me soft, it killed me hard, left me bare to the bones<br />
										But still I wanted to go back to the unknown<br />
										<br />
										Where do you go when your home is falling apart?<br />
										Where do you go when it's charred by the fire you start?<br />

										<hr>
										<h3>The cure</h3>
										The drooping eyes of His serenity dissipate <br />
										into an empty abyss carrying nothing<br />
										but a beaten carton of cigarettes.<br />
										The broken bi-focal glasses, unopened books,<br />
										bikes unpedaled, and primetime <br />
										splattered with idiotic formulaic episodes,<br />
										draining the function and fulfilling purpose <br />
										of our presence, of us.<br />
										<br />
										Us, the ones, driven to madness,<br />
										unknown to previous decades culminating, <br />
										in the fate of young brilliancy’s potential to explode <br />
										in a violent banging and popping, <br />
										the unbranded cataclysmic kaboom.<br />
										Consequently the unfamiliar melting, gooping, and dripping<br />
										of our own brains out of our own ears and<br />
										into the wastebasket of conformity’s mastermind<br />
										leaves our bodies to be the drones and do-nothings<br />
										of puppet-masters dressed in coats and ties.<br />
										It is Facebook, ‘what not to wear,’ Reebok pumps, <br />
										Doritos and MTV attacking the glory of boredom<br />
										leaving three-fourths of us in the dirty dumpsters<br />
										and the remaining gasping for air,<br />
										some contemplating suicide amongst price-tag materials<br />
										consuming themselves for consumerism, is the only thing they know.<br />
										<br />
										The dissonance is no longer there.<br />
										The abused machine has regressed thought<br />
										renaming the ‘rose-garden’ as just ‘thorns.’<br />
										We are suffocated by carbohydrate snacks,<br />
										twice-over processed meats, and question marks<br />
										created behind the curtains with no avail.<br />
										We have been trained to be anti-interrogative<br />
										as indistinguishable copies are produced<br />
										after years of riding the puppet-masters’ assembly line.<br />
										The curse, it is cast, Ginsberg and Burroughs <br />
										have been ordained into the hush of death<br />
										leaving the one’s unaffected by His hex<br />
										deprived of the all mighty pastel palette of whispers.<br />
										<br />
										The free minority have had to reconcile with their <br />
										desolated counterparts to make ends meet.<br />
										For the lonely hipster drowning in self-pity,<br />
										the quiet artist seeking intimacy and soul,<br />
										the lunch-time reader turning page after page,<br />
										for the unnamed, self conscious individual <br />
										trying to look forward as a cavalcade of empty nothings<br />
										fall onto his or her plate questioning the machine<br />
										and searching for a remedy to keep that<br />
										stomach full for just one night.<br />
										A remedy you wonder? A solution? An answer?<br />
										<br />
										All of this in time future and time past we will be.<br />
										We will be the next poets stirring the sleeping world<br />
										with overflowing words like T.S. Elliot,<br />
										we will be the next Albert Einstein<br />
										discovering the corners and awakening<br />
										the crevices of our own flowing minds,<br />
										we will be the next Pope John Paul II,<br />
										Andy Warhol, Barack Obama,<br />
										we will be the next face of hope.<br />
										Release the chains that bind,<br />
										the mind forged manacles, the obligation<br />
										we surrender to social networks.<br />
										The cure for boredom is not picking<br />
										split ends, or aimless channel up and <br />
										channel down on remotes detaching us <br />
										further from society. The cure is jazz, <br />
										Hitchcock and cranial freedom. The cure is us,<br />
										if we choose to be. We can be the cure.<br />
